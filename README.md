# Sleeper_League_Analysis

This repository aims to make personal use of the sleeper api python wrapper found here: https://github.com/dtsong/sleeper-api-wrapper
to analyze my fantasy football league and gain strategic insights.

I used these websites for PPR Superflex Dynasty Rankings:

https://www.fantasypros.com/nfl/rankings/dynasty-superflex.php

This file allowed me to sync player ids with player names:
